          <h3>What is Crypto Market Cap?</h3>
          <p>
            Crypto market cap is the total value of all the coins of a
            particular cryptocurrency that have been mined or are in
            circulation. Market capitalization is used to determine the ranking
            of cryptocurrencies. The higher the market cap of a particular
            crypto coin, the higher its ranking and share of the market. Crypto
            market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in
            circulation by its current price. For instance, to calculate the
            market cap of Ethereum, all you need to do is multiply the total
            number of Ethereum in circulation by the current price of one
            Ethereum and you will get its market cap.
          </p>

          <h3>How to compare Cryptocurrencies Market Cap?</h3>
          <div>
            As a financial metric, market cap allows you to compare the total
            circulating value of one cryptocurrency with another. Large cap
            cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have a market cap of
            over $10 billion. They typically consist of protocols that have
            demonstrated track records, and have a vibrant ecosystem of
            developers maintaining and enhancing the protocol, as well as
            building new projects on top of them. While market cap is a simple
            and intuitive comparison metric, it is not a perfect point of
            comparison. Some cryptocurrency projects may appear to have inflated
            market cap through price swings and the tokenomics of their supply.
            As such, it is best to use this metric as a reference alongside
            other metrics such as trading volume, liquidity, fully diluted
            valuation, and fundamentals during your research process.
